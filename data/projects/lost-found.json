    "Lost&Found is an audiovisual installation that explores the intersection between the vegetal, the material, and the algorithmic. It seeks to ask: Can technology help us reconnect with the nature that surrounds us? In an increasingly hyper-mediated and digitally saturated society, Lost&Found turns its attention to the silent and continuous activity of plants - beings that perceive, respond, and communicate in ways we are only beginning to understand."
