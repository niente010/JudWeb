    "Society can be tough and damaging to certain people that do not adjust to the standards that the culture and society expects from them.",
    "In this project, a voice wanted to be given to these people that had not fit in due to their sexual orientation and, as a result, had an identity crisis from having been discriminated against.",
    "The aim was not just to give them a voice, but to also create a manifesto explaining the existence of sexual diversity and creating an interactive implementation."
