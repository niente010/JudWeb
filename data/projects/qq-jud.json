    "For the premiere of Ofrena at the Montcada Theatre (Valencia), I was responsible for the complete visual design of the performance, including the conceptual development, production, and live technical execution of the audiovisual show.",
    "The proposal is built around a hybrid system combining pre-produced visuals with real-time live processing, using generative and reactive effects developed in TouchDesigner, enabling a dynamic and adaptive visual narrative throughout the performance."
