    "Universal Remedy is a conceptual installation that explores the deep entanglement between perception and reality. Drawing from Walter Benjamin’s idea that perception is a world-shaping force, the project centres on umwelt, the notion that each living being experiences reality through its unique mode of sensing. From the echolocation of bats to the chemical sensitivity of plants, perception is plural, layered, and specific.\n"
