  "text": "I'm Judith — a ==multidisciplinary artist==, ==visual designer==, and ==creative technologist== based in Barcelona. My work lies at the intersection of art, technology, and sensory storytelling, combining creative coding, new media, artificial intelligence, video production, and live-mixing tools. I'm driven by deep curiosity, an adventurous spirit, a playful yet critical eye, and a genuine connection to nature and spirituality.\n\nI studied at the Faculty of Design and Engineering at Elisava and at Strate École de Design (Paris), complementing my education with an official degree in Stage Techniques and Control at CIFO (Barcelona), and a Master's in New Media specializing in multimedia design for entertainment in Madrid.\n\nThroughout my career, I've collaborated with collectives and institutions such as ==Telenoika, Mapping World Lab, Chounar, and Punto Singular==, developing video mapping installations, stage lighting, DMX systems, and experiential marketing productions. As a ==VJ==, I've performed at venues including Sala Apolo, Upload for Nitsa, and Caníbal, and I currently work as a video technician at ==Sala Razzmatazz==.\n\nI also co-develop ==AlgoLab==, an artistic lab with Veronika Gryshchuk, where we explore new media-based projects addressing current social and technological themes. Our work involves sci-tech research, focusing particularly on conceptualizing the tensions between contemporary society and emerging technologies.\n\nMy approach sees design as a tool for communication and connection, creating immersive and interactive experiences where the digital engages in dialogue with the human and more-than-human — from perception to emotion. I'm passionate about using cutting-edge technological tools to bring meaningful and innovative ideas to life."
